# UNIT 1 HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT: FINTECH CASE STUDY

ROOT INC

Root inc. was incorporated February 2015

The founders of the company are ALEX TIMM & DAN MANGES

ALEX TIMM’S FATHER WAS INVOLVED IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS. ALEX SEEMS TO HAVE INHERITED A LOVE FOR INSURANCE FROM HIS DAD. ONE COULD SAY HE HAS BEEN IN INSURANCE HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND HE IS ALL ABOUT INSURANCE. HE IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN DISRUPTING THE INEFFICIENCIES HE SEES IN THE MARKRETPLACE. TO THIS END HE FOUNDED THE COMPANY WITH IS PARTNER DAN MANGES.

ROOT STARTED WITH VENTURE INVESTMENT FUNDS OF $3,000,000.00 TO DATE THE COMPANY HAS RAISED OVER $500,000,000.00 AND IS VALUED @ $3.5 billion

THE COMPANY IS TRYING TO SOLVE THE INNEFFICIENCIES OF THE INSURANCE MARKET. IN PARTICULAR THE UNDERWRITTING STANDARDS FOR INSURING PEOPLE. THESE GUIDLINES ARE TRADITIONALLY BASED ON DEMOGRAPHICS AND INCOME OR WEALTH. THIS DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE RISK THEY PRESENT WHEN DRIVING, AS IT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR HOW THEY DRIVE. THE CURRENT STANDARDS FOR HOW A DRIVER IS INSURED IS NOT CORRELATED TO HOW THEY DRIVE. OTHER FACTORS ARE HEAVILY WEIGHTED IN DETERMINING PREMIUMS. THIS FINANCIAL INEQUALITY IS THE PROBLEM THE COMPANY IS TRYING TO SOLVE.

THE COMPANIES INTENDED CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE DRIVERS. THE PRODUCT THE COMPANY OFFERS SERVES TWO INTENTIONS. THE FIRST IS TO HAVE SAFE DRIVERS AND THE SECOND IS TO TRAIN DRIVERS IN BEING SAFE. 

THE GLOBAL INSURANCE TELEMATRICS SIZE WAS VALUED @ $2.19BILLION IN 2020. IT IS ESTIMATED TO GROW TO $6.24BILLON BY THE YEAR 2025 

THE SOLUTION THIS COMPANY OFFERS THAT THEIR COMPETITORS DO NOT IS TELEMATRICS. MOST INSURANCE COMPANIES USE CREDIT SCORES TO DETREMINE WETHER AN INSURED PERSON IS LIKELY TO MAKE A CLAIM. TELEMATRICS USES INTERNET OF THINGS DEVICES SUCH AS SMART PHONES AND APPS TO DETERMINE THE ACTIONS OF THE INSURED ARE WITHIN A REASONABLE SPECTRUM OF RISK THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE USER AND IS CONSIDERED USEAGE BASED

THE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE USED HERE IS MACHINE LEARNING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO DETERMINE PREMIUMS ADDITIONALLY THE PREMIUNS ARE USEAGE BASED, AS A RESULT THE NEED FOR AGENTS IS ELIMINATED ALL INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS ARE COMPLETED ON THE PHONE APP.

USEAGE BASED INSURANCE (UBI). BY COLLECTING DATA FROM PARTICIPANTS VIA THEIR SMARTPHONES, ROOT USES SELECTED ALGORITHMS TO UNDERSTAND DRIVING BEHAVIOR AND OFFER POLICIES TO DRIVERS.

ROOT IS IN THE INSURANCE DOMAIN SPECIFICALLY IN THE INSURANCE TELEMATRICS DOMAIN.

MAJOR INNOVATIONS INCLUDE THE USE OF SENSORS AND DEVELOPMENT OF TELEMATIS OVER THE LAST 5-10 YEARS. THE MAJOR TRENDS IN THIS DOMAIN OVER THE LAST 5-10 YEARS INCLUDE A TREND TOWARDS SAFETY. DRIVER SAFETY HAS ITS VOICE AND IS BEING HEARD. THE DECREASED COST OF CONNECTIVITY SOLUTIONS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO ENABLE THE SPACE OF INSURANCE TELEMATRICS TO DEVELOP FUTHER

OTHER MAJOR COMPANIES IN THIS DOMAIN INCLUDE PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE, STATE FARM, GEICO, NEXT INSURANCEA AND ACCEPTANCE INSURANCE


THIS COMPANY IS DISRUPTING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY BY DEMONSTRATING OTHER WAYS TO DETERMINE PREMIUMS DRIVING PREMIUMS LOWER AND OFFERING ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.

THE CORE MATRIX THAT COMPANIES IN THIS DOMAIN USE TO MEASURE SUCCESS INCLUDE THE LOWER COST OF PREMIUNS PASSED ON TO CUSTOMERS AND REDUCTION IN CLAIM COST. COMPANIES IN THIS DOMAIN EXPERIENCE A 50% REDUCYTION IN CLAIM COST.

FOR THE BEST 30% OF DRIVERS ROOT HAS CUT THEIR PEMIUMS BY 50% FOR THE BEST 70% OF DRIVERS ROOT IS THE CHEAPEST INSURANCE COMPANY.

ROOT IS THE LEADER IN USEAGE BASED INSURANCE WITH ITS CURRENT VALUATION AT OVER $1BILLION. ROOT IS THE LEADER IN USER BASED INSURNCE.

I WOULD SUGGEST ROOT EXPAND INTO PERSONALIZED SERVICES THAT REWARD PEOPLE WHO ACT RESPONSIBLY. IN AREAS OF CONCERN WHERE THERE ARE SECURITY CONCERNS ROOT COULD INCENTIVIZE RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR. ROOT COULD ALSO CREATE COMMUNITY POLICING. HOME AND PERSONAL SECURITY IS STILL OF CONCERN FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. CREATING GAMES IN WHICH RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR IS REWARDED IS AN AREA I WOULD SUGGEST THE COMPANY EXPLORE.

I THINK THIS WOULD EXPAND THE COMPANY GLOBALLY. THE DATA BENEFITS THE COMPANY WOULD ATTAIN SIMPLY THROUGH IT’S INITIAL OFFEREING OF INSURANCE FAR SURPASS ITS PRIMARY BUSINESS OF INSURANCE.

INTERNET OF THINGS, INTERNET CONECTIVITY, BLOCKCHAIN LEDGERS FOR VERIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION, COULD BE UTILIZED IN EXPANDING INTO THE SECURITY BUSINESS.

THESE TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE TO CAUSE CONNECTIVITY FOR USERS WHILST MAINTAINING WORKABILITY FOR COMMUNITIES.
