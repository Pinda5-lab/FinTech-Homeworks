# UNIT 1 HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT: FINTECH CASE STUDY

ROOT INC

ROOT INC. WAS INCORPORATED FEBRUARY 2015

THE FOUNDERS OF THE COMANY ARE ALEX TIMM & DAN MANGES

ALEX TIMM’S FATHER WAS INVOLVED IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS. ALEX SEEMS TO HAVE INHERITED A LOVE FOR INSURANCE FROM HIS DAD. ONE COULD SAY HE HAS BEEN IN INSURANCE HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND HE IS ALL ABOUT INSURANCE. HE IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN DISRUPTING THE INEFFICIENCIES HE SEES IN THE MARKRETPLACE. TO THIS END HE FOUNDED THE COMPANY WITH IS PARTNER DAN MANGES.

ROOT STARTED WITH VENTURE INVESTMENT FUNDS OF $3,000,000.00. TO DATE THE COMPANY HAS RAISED OVER $500,000,000.00 AND IS VALUED @ $3.5 billion

THE COMPANY IS TRYING TO SOLVE THE INNEFFICIENCIES OF THE INSURANCE MARKET. IN PARTICULAR THE UNDERWRITTING STANDARDS FOR INSURING PEOPLE. THESE GUIDLINES ARE TRADITIONALLY BASED ON DEMOGRAPHICS AND INCOME OR WEALTH. THIS DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE RISK OF THE DRIVER PRESENT WHEN DRIVING, AS IT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR HOW THEY DRIVE. THE CURRENT STANDARDS FOR HOW A DRIVER IS INSURED IS NOT CORRELATED TO HOW THEY DRIVE. OTHER FACTORS ARE HEAVILY WEIGHTED IN DETERMINING PREMIUMS. THIS INEQUALITY IS THE PROBLEM THE ROOT IS OUT TO SOLVE.

THE COMPANIES INTENDED CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE DRIVERS. THE PRODUCT THE COMPANY OFFERS SERVES TWO INTENTIONS. THE FIRST IS TO HAVE SAFE DRIVERS AND THE SECOND IS TO TRAIN DRIVERS IN BEING SAFE. 

ACCORDING TO GRANDVIEW REASEARCH ARTICLE PUBLISHED DEC 2019, THE GLOBAL INSURANCE TELEMATRICS SIZE IS VALUED @ $2.19BILLION IN 2020. IT IS ESTIMATED TO GROW TO $6.24BILLON BY THE YEAR 2025 

THE SOLUTION THIS COMPANY OFFERS THAT THEIR COMPETITORS DO NOT IS TELEMATRICS. MOST INSURANCE COMPANIES USE CREDIT SCORES TO DETREMINE WETHER AN INSURED PERSON IS LIKELY TO MAKE A CLAIM. TELEMATRICS USES INTERNET OF THINGS DEVICES SUCH AS SMART PHONES AND APPS TO DETERMINE THE DRIVING ACTIONS OF THE INSURED ARE WITHIN A REASONABLE SPECTRUM OF RISK THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE USER AND IS CONSIDERED USEAGE BASED

THE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE USED HERE IS MACHINE LEARNING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO DETERMINE PREMIUMS ADDITIONALLY THE PREMIUNS ARE USEAGE BASED, AS A RESULT THE NEED FOR AGENTS IS ELIMINATED ALL INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS ARE COMPLETED ON THE PHONE THROUGH AN APP.

USEAGE BASED INSURANCE (UBI). BY COLLECTING DATA FROM PARTICIPANTS VIA THEIR SMARTPHONES, ROOT USES SELECTED ALGORITHMS TO UNDERSTAND DRIVING BEHAVIOR AND OFFER POLICIES TO DRIVERS.

ROOT IS IN THE INSURANCE DOMAIN SPECIFICALLY IN THE INSURANCE TELEMATRICS DOMAIN.

MAJOR INNOVATIONS IN INSURANCE TELEMATICS INCLUDE THE USE OF SENSORS AND DEVELOPMENT OF TELEMATICS OVER THE LAST 5-10 YEARS. THE MAJOR TRENDS IN THIS DOMAIN OVER THE LAST 5-10 YEARS INCLUDE A TREND TOWARDS SAFETY. DRIVER SAFETY HAS ITS VOICE AND IS BEING HEARD. THE DECREASE IN COST OF CONNECTIVITY SOLUTIONS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO ENABLE THE SPACE OF INSURANCE TELEMATRICS TO DEVELOP FUTHER. LASTLY, THE TREND OF HUMAN CAPITAL BEING DEPLOYED TO TRANSFORMATION OF CONCEPTS INTO MEASUREABLE TRANSACTIONS STANDS TO SHIFT WHO WE KNOW OURSELVES AS HUMAN BEINGS.  

OTHER MAJOR COMPANIES IN THIS DOMAIN INCLUDE PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE, STATE FARM, GEICO, NEXT INSURANCEA AND ACCEPTANCE INSURANCE


THIS COMPANY IS DISRUPTING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY BY DEMONSTRATING OTHER WAYS TO DETERMINE PREMIUMS DRIVING PREMIUMS LOWER AND OFFERING ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.

THE CORE MATRIX THAT COMPANIES IN THIS DOMAIN USE TO MEASURE SUCCESS INCLUDE THE LOWER COST OF PREMIUNS PASSED ON TO CUSTOMERS AND REDUCTION IN CLAIM COST. COMPANIES IN THIS DOMAIN CAN EXPERIENCE A 50% REDUCYTION IN CLAIM COST.

ACCORDING TO ALEX TIMM, "FOR THE BEST 30% OF DRIVERS ROOT HAS CUT THEIR PEMIUMS BY 50% FOR THE BEST 70% OF DRIVERS ROOT IS THE CHEAPEST INSURANCE COMPANY".

ROOT IS THE LEADER IN USEAGE BASED INSURANCE WITH ITS CURRENT VALUATION AT OVER $1BILLION. ROOT IS THE LEADER IN USER BASED INSURNCE.

I WOULD SUGGEST ROOT EXPAND INTO PERSONALIZED SERVICES THAT REWARD PEOPLE WHO ACT RESPONSIBLY. IN AREAS OF CONCERN WHERE THERE ARE SECURITY CONCERNS ROOT COULD INCENTIVIZE RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR. ROOT COULD ALSO EXPAND INTO OTHER AREAS SUCH AS PERSONAL SECURITY. HOME AND PERSONAL SECURITY IS STILL OF CONCERN FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. CREATING GAMES IN WHICH RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR IS REWARDED IS AN AREA I WOULD SUGGEST THE COMPANY EXPLORE.

I THINK EXPANDING INTO HOME AND PERSONAL SECURITY WOULD EXPAND THE COMPANY GLOBALLY. THE BRANDING RECOGNITION THE COMPANY WOULD ATTAIN, SIMPLY THROUGH IT’S INITIAL OFFEREING OF INSURANCE, WOULD BE AN INTRODUCTION OF MANY OTHER SERVICES AVAILABLE TO ROOT.

INTERNET OF THINGS, INTERNET CONECTIVITY, BLOCKCHAIN LEDGERS FOR VERIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION, COULD BE UTILIZED IN EXPANDING INTO THE SECURITY BUSINESS.

THESE TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE TO CAUSE CONNECTIVITY FOR USERS WHILST MAINTAINING WORKABILITY FOR COMMUNITIES.
